# Neural-Networks

This repository contains two neural network projects for image classification tasks using Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. It includes both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for animal classification and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for handwritten digit recognition.

## Contents

### 1. CNN for Dog vs Cat Classification
- **File**: `CNN_Dogs_Cats.ipynb`
- **Description**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled animal images and demonstrates the use of convolutional layers, pooling, and dense layers to achieve accurate binary image classification.

### 2. MLP for MNIST Digit Recognition
- **File**: `MLP_MNIST.ipynb`
- **Description**: A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model designed to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This notebook showcases a simple feedforward neural network architecture with dense layers and softmax output for multi-class classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib notebook
